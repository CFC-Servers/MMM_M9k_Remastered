# M9k Remastered

Workshop Link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169649722

This is a Remastered version of the 'Original' M9k weapons pack.
It includes all original M9k extensions:
 * Small arms pack
 * Heavy weapons pack
 * Assault rifles pack
 * Specialties pack

They have been merged together and heavily optimized. Some features were removed, some were changed, and some were added.

**Can I use this to get all the Materials, Models and Sounds for other Servers? .. Yes!**

**This Addon is being maintained and updated constantly. Reported bugs WILL be fixed, so if you find one, please report it!**

**Most noticeable changes:**

Dynamic weapon accuracy (Similar to how weapons behave in CS:S or CS:GO)
 * All weapons have been changed to be more accurate while standing still and to be even more accurate while crouching and being still.
 * This effect is most noticeable on sniper rifles as its nearly impossible to hit anything without being scoped in and standing still.

All weapons have been rebalanced to be more fair and more fun at the same time.
 * Damage, RPM, Spread, Recoil etc.. Has been adjusted to be more fun and fair to shoot, and play against. (Yay for roleplayers).

Shotguns are actual shotguns now as they all shoot "birdshot" rounds instead of generic shotgun rounds.
 * NumShots drastically increased, damage drastically reduced.

Scopes have received QoL updates:
 * Changed max zooms for every scoped base weapon from 2 to 3.
 * Can now 'unzoom' by pressing the Reload key.
 
Not all Weapons have made it back.
 * Some weapons such as the Orbital Strike Canon, Davy crockett, Harpoon, Knife, and more have been removed but MIGHT be re-added in the future.
 
 **Full list of missing weapons:**
 * Damascus (Ninja sword)
 * Davy crockett
 * Fists
 * Harpoon
 * IED Detonator
 * Knife
 * m61 Frag Grenade
 * Machete
 * Nerve Gas
 * Nitro
 * Orbital Strike Canon
 * Sticky Grenade
 * Suicide bomb

Some models that used to have scopes no longer have scopes. This was done to streamline assault rifles and heavy weapons to fit their weapon base (Nobody used the scopes on them anyway).

**Hard to notice changes for non-developers:**
 * Every single script file has been optimized and modernized drastically. Around 70% of original code lines were removed since they basically do nothing or are not required anymore.
 * A massload of bugfixes, especially involving shotguns and weapons from the specialties pack.
 
# Compatibility

I cannot guarantee that you can use this Weapon pack as a base for other M9k-based weapons from the workshop. It might work, it might not. The best thing you can do is to test it out!
And if you are a Developer, I'd appreciate any contributions to this project.
